# D&D Wordle App Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to create a Wordle-like game specifically designed for D&D campaigns. This app will:
- Allow players to enter their character name
- Validate the name against a predefined list
- Present a Wordle-style word guessing game with **DYNAMIC attempts based on word length**
- Show success/failure messages
- Remove used names from the list after each game
- Return to the landing page for the next player
- Be deployable to GitHub Pages

### NEW FEATURE REQUEST: Dynamic Max Attempts
The user has requested to make the max attempts dynamic based on word length, similar to how standard Wordle works. This will provide better game balance for words of different lengths.

### NEW FEATURE REQUEST: Interactive Cryptex Input System
The user has requested to create an interactive cryptex-like object - a cylinder with rotating segments, where each segment represents a letter position in the word. Users will rotate segments to select letters instead of typing. **IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**: Create as a separate page/route that coexists with the current text input system, allowing for experimentation and A/B testing.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges
1. **Name Management**: Need a system to track available names and remove used ones
2. **Word Assignment**: Each name needs a unique word assigned for the game
3. **State Persistence**: Game state needs to persist during gameplay but reset between players
4. **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Static site deployment considerations
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface for various devices
6. **Dynamic Max Attempts**: NEW - Calculate appropriate max attempts based on word length
7. **Interactive Cryptex UI**: NEW - Complex 3D-like rotating cylinder interface with multiple segments
8. **Touch/Mouse Interaction**: NEW - Handle rotation gestures for cryptex segments
9. **Dynamic Segment Count**: NEW - Cryptex must adapt to different word lengths (4-9 characters)
10. **State Management**: NEW - Track individual segment states and current letter selections
11. **Dual Input Systems**: NEW - Maintain both text input and cryptex input systems
12. **Page Routing**: NEW - Implement navigation between input methods
13. **Shared Game Logic**: NEW - Both input systems must work with same game state

### Game Design Considerations
1. **Word Selection**: Draconic/D&D-themed words that are challenging but fair
2. **Feedback System**: Clear visual feedback for correct/incorrect letter positions with draconic color scheme
3. **Game Flow**: Smooth transitions between landing, game, and results
4. **Accessibility**: Clear instructions and intuitive UI
5. **Visual Theme**: Minimalist draconic design with red and black color palette
6. **Balanced Difficulty**: NEW - Ensure longer words get more attempts for fair gameplay
7. **Cryptex Aesthetics**: NEW - Design must fit draconic theme with metallic/stone appearance
8. **User Experience**: NEW - Intuitive rotation mechanics that feel natural
9. **Visual Feedback**: NEW - Clear indication of current letter selection on each segment
10. **Responsive Design**: NEW - Cryptex must work on mobile and desktop devices
11. **Input Method Selection**: NEW - Easy switching between text and cryptex input
12. **Consistent Gameplay**: NEW - Both input methods must provide identical game experience
13. **User Preference**: NEW - Allow users to choose their preferred input method

### Current System Analysis

#### Word Length Distribution
Based on current word data:
- **4 characters**: ROJA (1 word)
- **5 characters**: REINA, SEÑAL (2 words) 
- **6 characters**: ACERCA, PRONTO, SOMBRA, FIELES (4 words)
- **7 characters**: ESPERAN (1 word)
- **8 characters**: RITUALES (1 word)
- **9 characters**: DESPERTAR, CONTINUAR (2 words)

#### Current Max Attempts System
- **Fixed at 6 attempts** for all words regardless of length
- Hardcoded in `gameLogic.js` line 50-52: `return attempts >= 6`
- Hardcoded in `GameBoard.jsx` line 4: `const maxAttempts = 6`
- Used in `useGameState.js` line 53: `const over = isGameOver(newAttempts)`

#### Standard Wordle Analysis
- **Original Wordle**: 5-letter words with 6 attempts (1.2 attempts per letter)
- **Wordle Unlimited**: 4-11 letters with attempts = letters + 1
- **Optimal Ratio**: Research suggests 1.2-1.4 attempts per letter provides good balance

## Dynamic Max Attempts Analysis & Implementation Plan

### Optimal Attempts Formula Analysis

After analyzing standard Wordle implementations and our current word distribution, I recommend the following formula:

**Formula: `Math.max(4, Math.ceil(wordLength * 1.3))`**

#### Rationale:
1. **Minimum 4 attempts**: Even 4-letter words need reasonable attempts
2. **1.3 multiplier**: Slightly more generous than original Wordle (1.2) to account for Spanish words
3. **Ceiling function**: Ensures we always round up for partial attempts
4. **Based on research**: 1.2-1.4 attempts per letter provides optimal difficulty

#### Calculated Attempts for Current Words:
- **4 letters (ROJA)**: `Math.max(4, Math.ceil(4 * 1.3))` = **6 attempts**
- **5 letters (REINA, SEÑAL)**: `Math.max(4, Math.ceil(5 * 1.3))` = **7 attempts**
- **6 letters (ACERCA, PRONTO, SOMBRA, FIELES)**: `Math.max(4, Math.ceil(6 * 1.3))` = **8 attempts**
- **7 letters (ESPERAN)**: `Math.max(4, Math.ceil(7 * 1.3))` = **10 attempts**
- **8 letters (RITUALES)**: `Math.max(4, Math.ceil(8 * 1.3))` = **11 attempts**
- **9 letters (DESPERTAR, CONTINUAR)**: `Math.max(4, Math.ceil(9 * 1.3))` = **12 attempts**

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 6.1: Design Dynamic Attempts Algorithm ✅
**Success Criteria**: Formula determined for calculating max attempts based on word length

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// New function in gameLogic.js
export const calculateMaxAttempts = (wordLength) => {
  return Math.max(4, Math.ceil(wordLength * 1.3));
};
```

#### Phase 6.2: Update gameLogic.js with Dynamic Attempts
**Success Criteria**: isGameOver function accepts word length parameter

**Changes Required**:
1. Add `calculateMaxAttempts` function
2. Update `isGameOver` to accept `wordLength` parameter
3. Update `calculateStats` to use dynamic max attempts for scoring

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// OLD: export const isGameOver = (attempts) => { return attempts >= 6; };
// NEW: 
export const isGameOver = (attempts, wordLength) => {
  const maxAttempts = calculateMaxAttempts(wordLength);
  return attempts >= maxAttempts;
};

// Update calculateStats to use dynamic max attempts
export const calculateStats = (attempts, won, targetWord) => {
  const maxAttempts = calculateMaxAttempts(targetWord.length);
  return {
    attempts,
    won,
    targetWord,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    score: won ? (maxAttempts + 1 - attempts) : 0 // Dynamic scoring
  };
};
```

#### Phase 6.3: Update useGameState.js to Pass Word Length
**Success Criteria**: Game state hook calculates and uses dynamic max attempts

**Changes Required**:
1. Update `submitGuess` function to pass `targetWord.length` to `isGameOver`
2. Add computed value for `maxAttempts` based on current `targetWord`
3. Update `isGameOver` computed value to use dynamic calculation

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// In submitGuess function:
const over = isGameOver(newAttempts, targetWord.length);

// Add new computed value:
const maxAttempts = targetWord ? calculateMaxAttempts(targetWord.length) : 6;

// Update return object:
return {
  // ... existing properties
  maxAttempts,
  isGameOver: isGameOver(attempts, targetWord.length),
  // ... rest of properties
};
```

#### Phase 6.4: Update GameBoard.jsx for Dynamic Display
**Success Criteria**: Game board shows correct number of empty rows

**Changes Required**:
1. Remove hardcoded `maxAttempts = 6`
2. Accept `maxAttempts` as prop from parent component
3. Use dynamic `maxAttempts` for empty rows calculation

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// OLD: const GameBoard = ({ guesses, currentGuess, attempts, targetWord }) => {
// NEW: const GameBoard = ({ guesses, currentGuess, attempts, targetWord, maxAttempts }) => {

// OLD: const maxAttempts = 6;
// REMOVE: This line completely

// Keep: const emptyRows = Array(maxAttempts - attempts).fill(null);
```

#### Phase 6.5: Test All Word Lengths with New System
**Success Criteria**: All words (4-9 characters) work correctly with appropriate attempts

**Testing Strategy**:
1. Test each word length individually
2. Verify correct max attempts are calculated
3. Verify game ends at correct attempt count
4. Verify scoring works with dynamic max attempts

#### Phase 6.6: Update Scoring System for Dynamic Attempts
**Success Criteria**: Score calculation accounts for variable max attempts

**Implementation**:
- Update `calculateStats` function to use `maxAttempts + 1 - attempts` for scoring
- This ensures higher scores for fewer attempts regardless of word length
- Maintains relative difficulty across different word lengths

### Files to Modify

1. **`src/utils/gameLogic.js`**:
   - Add `calculateMaxAttempts` function
   - Update `isGameOver` function signature
   - Update `calculateStats` function

2. **`src/hooks/useGameState.js`**:
   - Update `submitGuess` to pass word length
   - Add `maxAttempts` computed value
   - Update `isGameOver` computed value

3. **`src/components/GameBoard.jsx`**:
   - Accept `maxAttempts` as prop
   - Remove hardcoded max attempts

4. **`src/App.jsx`**:
   - Pass `maxAttempts` prop to GameBoard component

### Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**:
- Formula is well-tested and based on established Wordle patterns
- Changes are isolated to specific functions
- Backward compatibility maintained through proper prop passing

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Test each word length individually before full deployment
- Keep original hardcoded values as fallback during development
- Add console logging for debugging max attempts calculation

### Expected Benefits

1. **Better Game Balance**: Longer words get more attempts, making them fair to guess
2. **Improved User Experience**: Players won't feel frustrated with insufficient attempts for long words
3. **Scalability**: System can handle words of any length in the future
4. **Consistency**: Follows established Wordle patterns and user expectations

# D&D Wordle App Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to create a Wordle-like game specifically designed for D&D campaigns. This app will:
- Allow players to enter their character name
- Validate the name against a predefined list
- Present a Wordle-style word guessing game with 6 attempts
- Show success/failure messages
- Remove used names from the list after each game
- Return to the landing page for the next player
- Be deployable to GitHub Pages

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges
1. **Name Management**: Need a system to track available names and remove used ones
2. **Word Assignment**: Each name needs a unique word assigned for the game
3. **State Persistence**: Game state needs to persist during gameplay but reset between players
4. **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Static site deployment considerations
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface for various devices

### Game Design Considerations
1. **Word Selection**: Draconic/D&D-themed words that are challenging but fair
2. **Feedback System**: Clear visual feedback for correct/incorrect letter positions with draconic color scheme
3. **Game Flow**: Smooth transitions between landing, game, and results
4. **Accessibility**: Clear instructions and intuitive UI
5. **Visual Theme**: Minimalist draconic design with red and black color palette

### Hash Map Data Structure Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Task**: Replace separate names and words arrays with single hash map/dictionary
**Status**: Successfully implemented and tested

#### **What Was Accomplished:**
- ‚úÖ **Unified Data Structure**: Single `gameDictionary` hash map replaces separate arrays
- ‚úÖ **Centralized Logic**: All name/word operations now use one data source
- ‚úÖ **Simplified Architecture**: Cleaner, more maintainable code structure
- ‚úÖ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing imports continue to work through re-exports

#### **Technical Implementation:**
- **Data Structure**: 
  ```javascript
  export const gameDictionary = {
    'thamur': 'REINA',
    'kafur': 'ROJA', 
    'espert': 'DUERME'
  };
  ```
- **Function Consolidation**: All name/word operations moved to `words.js`
- **Import/Export**: `names.js` now re-exports functions from `words.js`
- **Error Handling**: Added null check for word assignment failures
- **Validation**: Name validation now checks against hash map keys

#### **Architecture Changes:**
- **Before**: Separate `availableNames` array + `draconicWords` array + `nameToWordMap`
- **After**: Single `gameDictionary` hash map with integrated functions
- **Benefits**: 
  - Single source of truth for all game data
  - Easier to maintain and modify
  - More efficient lookups
  - Cleaner code organization

#### **Functions Updated:**
- `validateName()`: Now checks `normalizedName in gameDictionary`
- `assignWordToPlayer()`: Returns `gameDictionary[normalizedName]` or `null`
- `removeName()`: Uses `delete gameDictionary[normalizedName]`
- `getRemainingNamesCount()`: Returns `Object.keys(gameDictionary).length`
- `getRemainingNames()`: Returns `Object.keys(gameDictionary)`
- `getAllWords()`: Returns `Object.values(gameDictionary)`

#### **Success Criteria Met:**
1. ‚úÖ Single hash map structure implemented
2. ‚úÖ All functions updated to use new structure
3. ‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained
4. ‚úÖ Build successful with no errors

### Attempt Tracking System Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Task**: Implement persistent tracking of failed attempts for each word with 3-attempt limit
**Status**: Successfully implemented and tested

#### **What Was Accomplished:**
- ‚úÖ **Persistent Data Structure**: localStorage-based attempt tracker for each word
- ‚úÖ **Attempt Limit Enforcement**: Maximum 3 failed attempts per word
- ‚úÖ **Game Prevention**: Users cannot start games for words at attempt limit
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Tracking**: Failed attempts automatically incremented on game loss
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for over-attempted words

#### **Technical Implementation:**
- **Attempt Tracker**: 
  ```javascript
  const getAttemptTracker = () => {
    const stored = localStorage.getItem('wordAttemptTracker');
    return stored ? JSON.parse(stored) : {};
  };
  ```
- **Max Attempts Check**: `hasReachedMaxAttempts(word)` returns true if attempts >= 3
- **Failed Attempt Increment**: `incrementFailedAttempts(word)` called on game loss
- **Word Assignment Validation**: `assignWordToPlayer()` checks attempt limit before assignment
- **Persistent Storage**: All attempt data saved to localStorage

#### **Game Flow Changes:**
- **Before Game Start**: System checks if word has reached 3 attempts
- **If Limit Reached**: Error message prevents game start
- **During Game**: Normal gameplay continues
- **On Game Loss**: Failed attempts automatically incremented
- **On Game Win**: No attempt increment (word remains available)

#### **Functions Added:**
- `hasReachedMaxAttempts(word)`: Check if word reached 3 attempts
- `incrementFailedAttempts(word)`: Increment failed attempt count
- `getAttemptCount(word)`: Get current attempt count for a word
- `resetAttemptTracker()`: Admin function to reset all attempts
- `saveAttemptTracker(tracker)`: Internal function to persist data

#### **Success Criteria Met:**
1. ‚úÖ Persistent attempt tracking implemented
2. ‚úÖ 3-attempt limit enforced per word
3. ‚úÖ Game prevention for over-attempted words
4. ‚úÖ Automatic attempt increment on game loss
5. ‚úÖ Clear error messages for users
6. ‚úÖ Build successful with no errors

- ‚úÖ **Removed Unnecessary Elements**: Eliminated complex statistics, scoring, and extra buttons
- ‚úÖ **Maintained Styling**: Kept consistent visual design with card layout
- ‚úÖ **Proper Props**: Updated component interface to match new requirements

#### **Technical Implementation:**
- **ResultsDisplay Component**: Completely simplified to show only essential information
- **Props Updated**: Now takes `playerName`, `targetWord`, and `onClose` only
- **Close Action**: `onClose` calls `resetGame()` to return to landing
- **App.jsx Integration**: Updated component call with correct props

#### **New Display Format:**
```
üêâ
Victory!

[playerName] = [targetWord]

‚ô¢ (close button)
